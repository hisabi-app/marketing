# Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 30, 2025

## Introduction

At Hisabi, privacy isn't just a feature—it's our foundation. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our service.

Hisabi is available in two versions with different privacy models:

- **Open Source (Self-Hosted)**: We track absolutely zero data. Everything stays on your infrastructure.
- **Hisabi Cloud (Coming Soon)**: Your data is stored on our servers, but everything is fully encrypted.

## Who We Are

Hisabi is an open-source personal finance application that helps you track expenses by reading SMS messages from your bank. This is a personal project, not a company.

## Marketing Website

### Website Analytics (Minimal)
When you visit our marketing website, we may collect:
- Anonymous usage statistics (page views, visitor counts)

We use privacy-respecting analytics tools and do not use invasive tracking technologies.

If you choose to contact us or sign up for updates, we collect:

This information is only used to respond to your inquiries and is never shared with third parties.

## How We Use Your Data

### Self-Hosted Version
We don't use your data because we don't have access to it. Simple.

### Hisabi Cloud
Your encrypted data is used solely to provide the Hisabi service to you. We cannot read it, and we don't try to.

### Website Analytics
We use anonymous analytics to:
- Understand how visitors use our website
- Improve our documentation and user experience
- Measure the effectiveness of our communications

### Contact Information
We use your email address to:
- Respond to support requests
- Send updates about Hisabi (only if you opted in)

You can unsubscribe from promotional emails at any time.

## Data Storage and Security

### Self-Hosted Version
You control everything. Your data is stored wherever you choose to deploy Hisabi.

### Hisabi Cloud
Your data is stored on secure servers with encryption at rest.

### Contact Information
Email addresses and contact information are stored securely on our servers with encryption at rest and in transit.

## Third-Party Services

### Analytics
We may use privacy-focused analytics services (such as Plausible or similar) that do not use cookies or track individual users.

### Email Services
We use trusted email service providers to send transactional and marketing emails. These providers are GDPR-compliant and do not use your data for advertising.

### Payment Processing
If you purchase a license, payment information is processed by secure third-party payment processors. We never store your credit card information.

## Children's Privacy

Hisabi is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us immediately.

## Open Source Transparency

Hisabi is open source. You can review our code at [github.com/hisabi-app/hisabi](https://github.com/hisabi-app/hisabi) to verify our privacy claims. We believe in radical transparency.

## International Users

Hisabi is designed to work anywhere. Since your financial data stays on your device, there are no international data transfers of your sensitive information.

If you provide contact information, it may be stored on servers located in the United States or Europe, depending on our service providers.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes via:

## Summary

**What we believe:**
Privacy is a fundamental right. Your financial data is yours alone.

**What we do:**
We build tools that put you in control. Self-host for zero data collection, or use Hisabi Cloud with full encryption—either way, your privacy is protected.

**What we don't do:**
We don't sell your data. We don't share it with advertisers. With self-hosted, we don't even see it. With Cloud, we can't read it.

That's our promise.
